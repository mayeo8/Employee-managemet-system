first create your object that has to match your database schema
then create your database connection in a separate file
create an interface that will hold all the method that you will use fro the CRUD OPERATION
then create a class that implements that interface
that is where all the CRUD operation is carried out
now go to the main program create an instance of the class that implements the interface
then call its method when required and pass in the required parameter
all is an attempt to archive abstraction
